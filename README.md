# Introduction

This project is a free and opensource implementation of SecureDeviceGrid
(http://securedevicegrid.com/) communication protocol. The intention of this
effort is to enable independent non-commercial software, like OpenHAB
(http://openhab.org), to integrate products, made by Danfoss company (and
possibly some others, whose vendors chose to use the SecureDeviceGrid as their
communication platform), offering no other means of connectivity, except using
the cloud. Currently known such products include:

1. DEVIReg(tm) Smart floor heating thermostat (https://www.devismart.com/)
2. Danfoss Living Connect(tm) (http://www.smartheating.danfoss.com/)

This product is being developed using reverse engineering techniques. I, Pavel
Fedin, started this project on my own behalf in my own private time; and have
no affitiations with either Trifork or Danfoss companies, other than owning
a DEVIReg(tm) Smart product. My contact email is pavel_fedin@mail.ru.
